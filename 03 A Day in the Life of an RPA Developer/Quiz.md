## Quiz Questions

#### Q1. What is the correct description  for each of the six RPA implementation stages?

- [x] Process analysis- Implementation team analyses and identifies the requirements of the customerâ€™s process.
- [x] Development and Unit Testing- The modules outlined in the design whiteboard are created by the development team.
- [x] Discovery and kickoff- The initial implementation team assesses the potential automation complexity.
- [x] Solution design- Technical team designs a future state flow and maps out the various modules to be built.
- [x] Integration and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)- The implementation team conducts integration and UAT together with the business team.
- [x] Deployment and hypercare- Final process packages, libraries, and assets are migrated to the production Orchestrator.


#### Q2. What are the topics on which an RPA Developer collaborates with the RPA Solution Architect throughout the stages of an implementation?

- [x] When debugging
- [x] When testing
- [x] For mentoring
- [x] Reviewing and signing-off on the Development Specifications Document (DSD).
- [x] When troubleshooting



#### Q3. In which of the stages does an RPA Developer have the highest contribution and responsibility?

- [x] In the Development and Unit Testing, Integration and UAT, and Deployment and Hypercare stages.



#### Q4. Is there any difference when it comes to documenting a process versus documenting a procedure?

- [x] A process is typically documented via a diagram, be it a flowchart or workflow, which aims to highlight the logical sequence of the process steps. A procedure, on the other hand, is often a complex, written document, focused on providing guidelines


#### Q5. What are the correct categories for the following factors used to assess the automation potential of a process?

- [x] Semi-Automation- Processes that can be broken down into automated steps, and steps that must remain manual.
- [x] High-Cost RPA- Processes that are rather digital and can be automated, but use some complex technologies.
- [x] Zero-touch automation- Processes that are digital and involve a highly static system and process environment.
- [x] No RPA- Processes where change is frequent and multiple manual actions are needed.
